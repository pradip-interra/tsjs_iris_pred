# tsjs_iris_pred
Using TensorFlow JS to predict the Iris flower model, loaded the pretrained model.

This has the following features:

1. TensorFlow can run in browser in JavaScript.
2. It's a multi class, single output classification.
3. The pre-trained model is loaded such that the inference can be done in browser, training can be done outside.
4. It's fast, within a few ten's of milliseconds it runs purely in browser. So good for front end only apps.
